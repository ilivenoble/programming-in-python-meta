# PROGRAMMING IN PYTHON BY META - MY NOTES
## Procedural Programming
Developers can structure their code in many different ways. Python allows for object oriented, procedural, and functional programming models, or as they're often called paradigms. In this video, I'll focus on procedural programming, which is like writing step-by-step instructions this program executes. It's an important stepping stone to object oriented programming. Therefore, as a new developer, it's important to learn more about it. The main purpose of a programming model is to structure your code. That structure makes it easier to update the code and create new functionality within the code. But there's no one perfect model that's a solution to coding structures, and sometimes a combination of approaches works best. Procedural programming structures code into procedures, sometimes called subroutines or functional sections of code. Because of this approach, the code is made up of logical steps to complete a specific task.

### Example
A typical example of procedural programming is as shown below.
```
a = 5
b = 10
c = a + b 
print(c) # 15
````
In summary, the advantages of the procedural paradigm are, it's easy for beginners to learn and get started. Procedures can be reused by other parts of the code. Code is easy to understand because each procedure is broken into specific tasks. Procedural programming does have some disadvantages, including it can be hard to maintain and extend. In some cases, it doesn't relate well to real-world objects. Data is exposed throughout the whole program. Procedural programming has both its advantages and disadvantages. 

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions that is completed in a step-by-step way to solve a particular problem. But how do you go about writing one from scratch? There are different approaches to this. Some people like to write pseudocode, English-like syntax that resembles code, to explain the problem in a series of steps. Another approach is to use a flow chart that provides a graphical representation of the series of steps. The flow chart goes through the logical flow of the algorithm and shows the different decisions that need to be made in order to solve it.

There are many different types of algorithms that have been designed to solve all kinds of different types of problems in computer science. When writing an algorithm, it can be solved in many different ways and each can have its own pros and cons. 

### Recursion
Recursion refers to a method or a function that will call itself. It is used to resolve problems by breaking the problem down into sub-problems. Let us take a look at some of the most popular types of recursive algorithms.

- ### Divide and conquer
This consists of two parts. The first is breaking the problem down into smaller sub-problems and the second is solving the final solution.

- ### Dynamic programming
This is mainly used for optimization problems. It is similar to the divide and conquer algorithm in that it splits the problems into sub-problems.

- ### Greedy algorithm
This one finds the best solution in each and every step instead of approaching optimization in a global way.
